# yaesu-ftdx10-cw-controller

program to control a YAESU FTDX10 radio in CW (FT817/8 to follow)

this is software made for my own use but i like to share with the HAMradio community under MIT licence

goal off the program is 

to control/change the CW memories in a FTDX10 radio direct and only via CAT (or other yaesu radio's using the same protocol definition).
to control a CWkey input on any radio via a simple arduino circuit/keyer in my situation a FT818.
to readout freq via CAT from a FT817/818 for logbook functionality.
to generate a ADIF log for onetime outdoor events like pota (no full logbook functionality).

offcoarse any input is welcome.
feel free to add a issue or feature request.
feel free to use code if you can use it in your own project.
have respect for developers and there licences in the used dependencies when you do so.
